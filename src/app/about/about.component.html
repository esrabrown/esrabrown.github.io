    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Esra Brown. </p> 
    <p>Born and raised in Turkiye, I had the opportunity to experience different cultures and perspectives. In 2017, I decided to embark on a new adventure and moved to Spain, where I further expanded my horizons. A year later, in 2018, I made the bold decision to relocate to the United States, seeking new opportunities and challenges.</p>
    <p>Throughout my journey, I have explored various career paths, each providing valuable experiences and insights. However, I felt a strong calling towards utilizing my problem-solving skills in a more dynamic and impactful way. It was during this time that I discovered my passion for programming and the limitless possibilities it offers.</p>
    <p>In September 2022, I was fortunate to be accepted into LaunchCode, a renowned coding program, which marked the beginning of my formal coding education. Since then, I have been fully immersed in the world of programming, constantly expanding my knowledge and honing my skills.</p>
    <p>The combination of my diverse background, problem-solving abilities, and the passion I have found in coding has ignited a deep motivation within me. I am committed to continuous learning, embracing new challenges, and leveraging technology to create innovative solutions.</p>
    <p>I am excited to embark on this journey as a developer, utilizing my unique perspectives and experiences to contribute to the ever-evolving field of programming.</p>
